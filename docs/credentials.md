# Obtaining Credentials

## Obtaining `postman-api-key`

The `postman-api-key` is a Postman API key (PMAK) used for all standard Postman API operations: creating workspaces, uploading specs, generating collections, exporting artifacts, and managing environments.

**To generate one:**

1. Open the Postman desktop app or web UI.
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) > **Account Settings** > **API Keys**.
3. Click **Generate API Key**, give it a label, and copy the key (starts with `PMAK-`).
4. Set it as a GitHub secret:

   ```bash
   gh secret set POSTMAN_API_KEY --repo <owner>/<repo>
   ```

> **Note:** The PMAK is a long-lived key tied to your Postman account. It does not require periodic renewal like the `postman-access-token`.

## Obtaining `postman-access-token` (Customer Preview)

> **Customer Preview limitation:** The `postman-access-token` input requires a manually-extracted session token. There is currently no public API to exchange a Postman API key (PMAK) for an access token programmatically. This manual step will be eliminated before GA.

The `postman-access-token` is a Postman session token required for workspace enrichment operations that the standard PMAK API key cannot perform, including governance group assignment, cloud spec-to-collection syncing, and canonical workspace validation during reruns. Without it, those steps degrade to warning-based behavior and name-based workspace fallback during provisioning.

**To obtain and configure the token:**

1. **Log in via the Postman CLI** (requires a browser):

   ```bash
   postman login
   ```

   This opens a browser window for Postman's PKCE OAuth flow. Complete the sign-in.

2. **Extract the access token** from the CLI credential store:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.postman/postmanrc | jq -r '.login._profiles[].accessToken'
   ```

3. **Set it as a GitHub secret** on your repository or organization:

   ```bash
   # Repository-level secret
   gh secret set POSTMAN_ACCESS_TOKEN --repo <owner>/<repo>

   # Organization-level secret (recommended for multi-repo use)
   gh secret set POSTMAN_ACCESS_TOKEN --org <org> --visibility selected --repos <repo1>,<repo2>
   ```

   Paste the token value when prompted.

> **Important:** This token is session-scoped and will expire. When it does, operations that depend on it (governance and canonical workspace validation) degrade with warnings and fallback behavior. You will need to repeat the login and secret update process. There is no automated refresh mechanism.

> **Note:** `postman login --with-api-key` stores a PMAK. These APIs require the session token, so you must use the interactive browser login.
